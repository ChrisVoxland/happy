<!--
	probably have to add a feature to change map size based on type of device
	eventually move javascript and css stuff to different files
	use event handlers to display more/less/different places based on zoom level
	when users enter new address, use ajax to send a request to geocache it through their browser, and use returning loc to position place
	eventually add directions functionality
	maybe eventually connect it to google users? allow people to log in, could allow eventual connection to their equivalent to yelp
